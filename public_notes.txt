2024-12-18 Set base_url to cs.ubc
> edit hugo.toml: 
	baseURL = 'https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rikblok/'
	title = "Rik's Treehouse"
* seems to be overridden by github hugo deploy action 👍  So I can deploy to both servers:
	https://rikblok.github.io/treehouse/
	https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rikblok/


2024-12-17 Added Relearn theme
> cd themes
> git submodule add https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn
> edit hugo.toml: 
	theme = 'hugo-theme-relearn'
